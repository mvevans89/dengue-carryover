  abstract = {The chronic effects of exposure of Culex restuans (Theobald) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) to low concentrations of malathion were examined by exposing larvae of the two species to four malathion doses at 20, 25, and 30 degrees C and maintaining the resulting adults at 25 degrees C. For both species, a significant temperature by malathion interaction on survival was found. Greater temperatures at the highest malathion dosage had significantly lower survivorship than in other treatments, but this effect was not observed at 20 degrees C. These results suggest that low temperature may buffer against some of the negative effects of malathion. For both species, temperature but not malathion had significant effects on female developmental time to adulthood and adult longevity. Temperature also affected adult female size for Ae. albopictus but not Cx. restuans. Ae. albopictus females developed faster as temperature increased, lived longer when larvae were maintained at 30 degrees C than at 20 degrees C, and were larger when larvae were maintained at 25 degrees C than at 20 or 30 degrees C. Cx. restuans females developed faster at 25 and 30 degrees C than at 20 degrees C and lived longer at 25 degrees C than at 20 or 30 degrees C. The estimated finite rate of increase (lambda') for Cx. restuans was significantly lower at 20 degrees C than at 25 and 30 degrees C, whereas that of Ae. albopictus was significantly influenced by an interaction between temperature and malathion with significantly lower lambda' at 20 degrees C than at 25 and 30 degrees C for all malathion treatments except 0.014 mg liter(-1). Understanding how pesticides interact with abiotic environmental conditions will contribute to management decisions about vector control practices.},

  abstract = {Temperature is one of the most important environmental factors affecting biological processes of mosquitoes, including their interactions with viruses. In these studies, we show independent effects of rearing temperature on the immature aquatic stages and holding temperature on the adult terrestrial stage in terms of alterations in adult survival and progression of dengue-1 virus infection in the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus. Our studies show that adult survival was determined by adult-holding temperature, regardless of rearing conditions of the immature stages. In contrast, spread of virus throughout the body of the mosquito, a pre-requisite for transmission, was reduced when the immature stages were reared in cool conditions. These results show that immature-rearing temperature selectively modified mosquito traits that influence competency for viruses, and they further our understanding of the nature of temperature effects on interactions between mosquitoes and virus pathogens and risk of disease transmission.;},

  volume = {86},
  issn = {0012-9658},
  abstract = {Both density-mediated and trait-mediated indirect biotic interactions may be important in structuring communities. Indirect interactions in many study systems remain unexplored; in part, because they are often difficult to detect, and in many instances, have been identified empirically only when unexpected results arise. Indirect effects induced by competition may be particularly important among organisms with complex life cycles, wherein competitive effects experienced in one life stage influence species interactions in one or more subsequent stages. We determined whether species-specific effects of larval competition in the mosquitoes Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti have indirect effects at the adult stage, specifically testing for effects on arboviral infection with Sindbis virus (SINV). For A. albopictus, but not for A. aegypti, competition resulted in greater infection, body titer, and dissemination rates compared to low-competition conditions. Whole body titers of virus increased with adult size irrespective of competition. However, between competitive treatments, mosquitoes from low-competition conditions had greater mean size, with lower infection rates and lower whole body titers than the smaller mosquitoes from high-competition conditions. These results suggest that larval competition, common in natural mosquito populations, has important indirect effects on adults by altering mosquito-virus interactions. Such indirect effects may change transmission parameters of pathogens.},

  abstract = {The Arrhenius Law, which was originally proposed to describe the temperature dependence of the specific reaction rate constant in chemical reactions, does not adequately describe the effect of temperature on bacterial growth. Microbiologists have attempted to apply a modified version of this law to bacterial growth by replacing the reaction rate constant by the growth rate constant, but the modified law relationship fits data poorly, as graphs of the logarithm of the growth rate constant against reciprocal absolute temperature result in curves rather than straight lines. Instead, a linear relationship between in square root of growth rate constant (r) and temperature (T), namely, square root = b (T - T0), where b is the regression coefficient and T0 is a hypothetical temperature which is an intrinsic property of the organism, is proposed and found to apply to the growth of a wide range of bacteria. The relationship is also applicable to nucleotide breakdown and to the growth of yeast and molds.},

Development and survival rates of both the Anopheles mosquitoes and the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria depend on temperature, making this a potential driver of mosquito population dynamics and malaria transmission. We developed a temperature-dependent, stage-structured delayed differential equation model to better understand how climate determines risk. Including the full mosquito life cycle in the model reveals that the mosquito population abundance is more sensitive to temperature than previously thought because it is strongly influenced by the dynamics of the juvenile mosquito stages whose vital rates are also temperature-dependent. Additionally, the model predicts a peak in abundance of mosquitoes old enough to vector malaria at more accurate temperatures than previous models. Our results point to the importance of incorporating detailed vector biology into models for predicting the risk for vector borne diseases.},
