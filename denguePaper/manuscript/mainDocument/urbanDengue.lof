Date ranges with green and orange background represent the summer and fall trials, respectively. The solid line represents the mean temperature across trays in each land class. The dotted lines represent the mean minimum and maximum temperatures across trays in each land class.}}{31}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {5}{\ignorespaces The calculated vectorial capacity by site across individual mean temperature prior to infection assays (a). The incorporation of carry-over effects reduces the expected vectorial capacity at sites, although the effect is lessened at cooler temperatures. Inset charts on the right indicate calculated vectorial capacity without carry-over effects (b), with carry-over effects (c), and the percent difference due to the incorporation of carry-over effects (d). Error bars represent standard error. }}{34}
