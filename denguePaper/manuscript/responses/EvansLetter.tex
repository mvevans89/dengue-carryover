Dear Dr. Weetman:\\

Please find attached a revised version of our manuscript `Carry-over effects of urban larval environments on the transmission potential of a mosquito-borne pathogen'', which we would like to resubmit for publication as a Research Article in \textit{Parasites and Vectors}.\\

Your comments and those of the reviewers were insightful and informative, and greatly enhanced the quality of our manuscript.  In the following pages are our responses to each of the comments.\\

Reviewers' comments are written in standard font, with our replies directly following in italics. Revisions in the text are shown using MS Word track changes. We hope that the revisions and our accompanying responses will be sufficient to make our manuscript suitable for publication in \textit{Parasites and Vectors}.\\

I can be reached by email (mvevans@uga.edu), phone (703 725 9580), or post (Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia, Athens GA 30602). Thank you for your consideration. \\

Sincerely,\\
Michelle Evans
